# SquadStash

SquadStash is a personal + group savings and expense tracking app that solves two common trip problems:

1) **Saving consistently for a trip goal** (e.g., $5,000 for 5 people)  
2) **Fairly settling shared expenses during/after the trip** (hotel, gas, restaurants, activities)

It also doubles as a personal “buckets” budgeting tool for everyday life.

## Why SquadStash

Group trips often fall apart financially because:
- People struggle to save consistently toward a shared goal
- Expenses are uneven (different meals, different spending)
- Settling up afterward becomes confusing (“Who owes who?”)

SquadStash makes it easier to plan, save, spend, and settle—clearly and fairly.
